# 🛡️ AI Security Feature Demos

> Comparative demonstrations of AI security guardrail mechanisms and adversarial defenses inspired by industry research and competitor analysis.

---

## Overview

This repository presents a curated set of **AI security feature demos** designed to illustrate how different guardrail systems handle prompt injection, jailbreaks, data exfiltration attempts, and adversarial attacks.

Each demo highlights:
- Implementation examples of protection strategies.
- Comparative notes from **competitor product research**.
- Observations about **defensive behavior** across models and providers.

These demos are provided **strictly for educational and analytical purposes** to advance understanding of guardrail design—not for reuse, adaptation, or replication in other systems.
